Curious to see if someone has already written the custom `Kernel` you are thinking of or runs **Parcels** with the same hydrodynamic data? Check out the parcels_contributions repository and share examples with other users!

## Analysis code

The following is an alphabetically sorted list of tools for analysing Lagrangian trajectory output:

- [Lagrangian Diagnostics](https://lagrangian-diags.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (![maintainer needed](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintainer_needed-red)): Are you interested in advanced analysis and diagnostics of Parcels output or Lagrangian trajectories in general? The Lagrangian Diagnostics project provides code and descriptions of different analyses.
- [Lagrangian Trajectories Toolbox](https://github.com/oj-tooth/lt_toolbox): A Python library dedicated to the post-processing, visualisation and analysis of Lagrangian particle trajectories. This library assumes trajectories are stored as tabular output (e..g, Parquet or CSV).
- [TrajAn](https://github.com/OpenDrift/trajan): A Python package for analysing and plotting ocean drifter and trajectory data stored, developed as part of the OpenDrift project. This library assumes trajectories are stored as CF-compliant Netcdf/Zarr output.

## Projects that use Parcels

The following is an alphabetically sorted list of projects that use Parcels:

- [LOCATE](https://github.com/UPC-LOCATE/LOCATE/): A collection of numerical tools developed within LOCATE ESA-funded project to build simulations of plastic particle dispersion in nearshore water.
- [PlasticParcels](https://github.com/Parcels-code/plasticparcels): A tool - based on Parcels - providing a modular and customisable collection of methods, notebooks, and tutorials for advecting virtual plastic particles with a wide range of physical properties.
- [pyPlume](https://github.com/jerukan/PyPlume): A collection of notebooks and methods made unifying the process of loading two-dimensional oceanic current vector fields from models and observations, simulating trajectory models, and analyzing and visualizing particle trajectories.
- [VirtualFleet](https://github.com/euroargodev/VirtualFleet): Make and analyse simulations of virtual Argo float trajectories
- [VirtualShip](https://virtualship.parcels-code.org/): A framework to plan and conduct a virtual research expedition, receiving measurements as if they were coming from actual oceanographic instruments.

## Other Lagrangian software

The following is an alphabetically sorted list of other Lagrangian ocean modelling and analysis software:
